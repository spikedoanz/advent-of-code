# Thoughts on each day of advent of code 2023 #

## Day 1 ##
- ~ 20 minutes, wasn't the worst thing in the world thanks to python's .startwith(substring) function. This made part 2 really easy

## Day 2 ##
- ~ 17 minutes, super easy. Think I got lucky with the way I stored the intermediate tables for counting up the occurance of the colors

## Day 3 ##
- ~ 2 hours . Absolutely wrecked my shit. I should have used regex instead of doing manual string parsing. Had to dig on reddit for extra test cases. There were far too many moving parts

## Day 4 ##
- ~ 10 minutes. lil ~baby~man~
