# ❄️ The joy of programming through advent of code ❄️ #

As a personal challenge and learning exercise, I am doing every year of Advent of Code in as many languages as possible. I also intend for this to be a repository for my more decent samples of code. So if that's what you're looking for, you've found the right place.

Note that per copyright and [Eric Wastl's request](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs/), input files are not included in this repository, so you must replace the file paths if you would like to run this code. The naming scheme is simply 'inputday{day number}.txt'.

### 2023 Solutions
| Day           | Part 1 | Part 2 | Commentary |
|---------------|--------|--------|------------|
| [01](2023/day1.py) | ✅ | ✅ | Learnt about [.startswith()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_startswith.asp), this made parsing the notorious 'twone' trivial for me|
| [02](2023/day2.py) | ✅ | ✅ | Data structures are great! Part 2 was solved in less than a minute because of it|
| [03](2023/day3.py) | ✅ | ✅ | A tough one. Was NOT expecting 2D array parsing this early in the competition|
| [04](2023/day4.py) | ✅ | ✅ | I appreciate the fact they made monday's puzzle easy :')|
| [05](2023/day5.py) | ✅ | ✅ | A challenge in optimization. This was much harder in implementation than in conceptualization|
| [06](2023/day6.py) | ✅ | ✅ | Brute force go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR|
| [07](2023/day7.py) | ✅ | ✅ | I managed to get a bit sneaky with implicitly using .sort() to handle the hand orderings. Also used an import for the first time |
