As a personal challenge and learning exercise, I am doing every year of Advent of Code in as many languages as possible. 

Note that per copyright and [Eric Wastl's request](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/copyright/inputs/), input files are not included in this repository, so you must replace the file paths if you would like to run this code. The naming scheme is simply 'inputday{day number}.txt'.

| Year | Languages Planned |
|------|-------------------|
| 2023 | Python |
| 2022 | Javascript|
| 2021 | Go |
| 2020 | Rust |
| 2019 | Clojure |
| 2018 | Lean |
| 2017 | C/C++ |
| 2016 | Javascript (placeholder) |
| 2015 | Haskell |
